Skills: The value of a final variable can only be set once. The constructor is the only place in the code for a class that you can guarantee this will hold true; the constructor is only ever called once for an object but other methods can be called any number of times.

Skills: You cannot mock your own method, can mock only proxy
		Ser/Des test, test cases: test empty, normal and null.
		Use assert instead of System.out.print() since it's didn't need to look at the output to determine whether it is right


		If you have somewhat of a legacy application, and you're not allowed to change the visibility of your methods, the best way to test private methods is to use reflection.

		Internally we're using helpers to get/set private and private static variables as well as invoke private and private static methods. The following patterns will let you do pretty much anything related to the private methods and fields. Of course you can't change private static final variables through reflection.

		Method method = targetClass.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, argClasses);
		method.setAccessible(true);
		return method.invoke(targetObject, argObjects);

		And for fields:

		Field field = targetClass.getDeclaredField(fieldName);
		field.setAccessible(true);
		field.set(object, value);
		
		Notes:
		1. targetClass.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, argClasses) lets you look into private methods. The same thing applies for  getDeclaredField.
		2. The setAccessible(true) is required to play around with privates.


		Often, developers spend a huge amount of time and effort in writing test cases that ensure the application works as expected. However, it is important to test negative test cases as well. A negative test case is a test case that tests if a system can handle invalid data. For example, consider a simple function which reads an alphanumeric value of length 8, typed by a user. In addition to alphanumeric values, the following negative test cases should be tested:

		User specifies non – alphanumeric values like special characters
		User specifies blank value
		User specifies a value which is larger or smaller than 8 characters
		Similarly, a borderline test case tests if the system works well for extreme values. For example, if a user is expected to enter a numeric value from 1 to 100, 1 and 100 are the borderline values and it is very important to test the system for these values.


ToLearn: reflection, best practice of what you want to learn


11/3

To Learn: Stub, Mock and Spy
			Java doc
			Logger
			Threading

Skills: shift + F6 to refactor(rename)
		command + p: hint for method signature

		When you copy stuff from other files, it may copy it's package and class info. Eg: I coped a Logger from another class, it automatically copy the "import static com.amazon.fresh.fab.common.proxy.interfaces.RtipProxy.LOGGER;" from the original class, while I am intending to create my own Logger.

		format your common variables for a test better so that when someone else comes back to this test later, they don't have to puzzle out what is going on. For example, all of the constants here should be private static final variables with capitalized names with underscores: VENDOR_CODE, ASIN, etc.

		avoid using LocalDate.now() in these types of tests, especially if there's timezones involved. You can pick a date that represents your "start" for the test. I tend to use something easy to remember and do math on, like new LocalDate(2016, 1, 1).

		You should also try to group constants together logically with newlines between groups

		Unit test doesn't mean that you can assume the method is only execute once.

		JUnit provides overloaded assertion methods for all primitive types and Objects and arrays (of primitives or Objects). The parameter order is expected value followed by actual value. Optionally the first parameter can be a String message that is output on failure. There is a slightly different assertion, assertThat that has parameters of the optional failure message, the actual value, and a Matcher object. Note that expected and actual are reversed compared to the other assert methods.

		Exception testing(https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Exception-testing)

		The @Test annotation has an optional parameter "expected" that takes as values subclasses of Throwable. 
		@Test(expected = IndexOutOfBoundsException.class) 
		public void empty() { 
		     new ArrayList<Object>().get(0); 
		}

		When to use fail in unit test?
		mark a test that is incomplete, so it fails and warns you until you can finish it
		making sure an exception is thrown:

		@Test
		public void testExceptionMessage() {
		    try {
		        new ArrayList<Object>().get(0);
		        fail("Expected an IndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown");
		    } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException anIndexOutOfBoundsException) {
		        assertThat(anIndexOutOfBoundsException.getMessage(), is("Index: 0, Size: 0"));
		    }
		}

		prefer asserThat than assetEqual ...

		The default JUnit runner treats tests with failing assumptions as ignored. 

		Execute order: 
		@BeforeClass setUpClass
		@Before setUp
		@Test test2()
		@After tearDown
		@Before setUp
		@Test test1()
		@After tearDown
		@AfterClass tearDownClass

Skills: we can use slowTest and fastTest to separate different test to save some time when running fast test.

		Dependency Inversion: 
		High level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
		Abstractions should never depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.


		Open/Closed:
		It means that you should put new code in new classes/modules. Existing code should be modified only for bug fixing. New classes can reuse existing code via inheritance.Open/closed principle is intended to mitigate risk when introducing new functionality. Since you don't modify existing code you can be assured that it wouldn't be broken. It reduce maintenance cost and increase product stability.

		You don't add testability by adding tests. You add testability by using SOLID design.

		The test class above shows something unusual: the second test method declares a parameter! Normally, JUnit/TestNG test methods are not allowed to have parameters. When using JMockit, however, such mock parameters are allowed. In general, it's best to use mock fields of the test class only when the mocked types are needed by most or all tests in the class. Otherwise, mock parameters with scope limited to a single test are preferred. JMockit will always take care of instantiating the mocked type and either assigning the instance to the mock field (provided the field is not final) or passing it as an argument when the test method is invoked by the test runner.

Lessons: "git revert" will automatically make another commit with the old verison code
		Use "git revert -n" to revert to old version and keep the file changes
		Don't use "git rebase" when you are not sure you are all set, it will destroy the history and maybe be very hard to recover




11/8
Skills: The only time fields on test classes should be static is when they're static and final (constants like you've got above here). Otherwise, they should be fields if they are used in multiple tests or set as parameters for @Parameterized tests. Otherwise, everything should be method local so we don't run into weirdness where tests fail because they run in a different order than we expected.

		Work on subtasks separately, create a local branch after finish a task

		Trace - Only when I would be "tracing" the code and trying to find one part of a function specifically.
		Debug - Information that is diagnostically helpful to people more than just developers (IT, sysadmins, etc.).
		Info - Generally useful information to log (service start/stop, configuration assumptions, etc). Info I want to always have available but usually don't care about under normal circumstances. This is my out-of-the-box config level.
		Warn - Anything that can potentially cause application oddities, but for which I am automatically recovering. (Such as switching from a primary to backup server, retrying an operation, missing secondary data, etc.)
		Error - Any error which is fatal to the operation, but not the service or application (can't open a required file, missing data, etc.). These errors will force user (administrator, or direct user) intervention. These are usually reserved (in my apps) for incorrect connection strings, missing services, etc.
		Fatal - Any error that is forcing a shutdown of the service or application to prevent data loss (or further data loss). I reserve these only for the most heinous errors and situations where there is guaranteed to have been data corruption or loss.

		After finish a task and push that branch, delete that branch because you no longer need it
		Ww can use @Parameter and switch/case to write test in a clear way
		We can make testcase such as "BeforeClass" and "AfterCLass" a class, so we can reuse it in other classes

		Git merge local change to dev:
		git checkout dev
		git merge --no-ff myFeature
		The --no-ff flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.
